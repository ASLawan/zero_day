# How to code with your local Computer

Creating an alternative environment to code from besides the Sandbox.

## Virtual Machine

This project involved downloading tools and installations to setup an environment 
to code from and submit assignments.
For this very project we decided to go with virtual box and vagrant to create our
virtual machine environment. To realize this, the following installations and 
configuarations were made.

### Intallations
*Virtual Box
*Vagrant
*Ubuntu
The installations are OS-specific, so for each of the above you select the options
based on your OS.

### Configurations
*Install git on the new created virtual machine.
*Configure username and email.
*Link to github.
